# Java Basics

# Comments
Comments are lines of code that are ignored intentionally. They are a great way to make notes for yourself and people reading your code.
There are two types of comments in Javascript
1. // this is an inline comment
2. /**/ this is a multi-line comment
Good commenting can help communicate the intent of your code, both for others and your future self.

# Variables
One of the most fundamental characteristics of a programmining language is the type of data it supports. These are the type of values that can be manipulated 
and represented in a programmining language.
Javascript allows you to work with primitive data types
1. Numbers e.g. 123, 120.50, etc.
2. Strings of text e.g. "This is a string".
3. Boolean e.g. true or false.
Javascript also defines two trivial data types: Null and Undefined.
JavaScript supports a composit data type known as an Object.
JavaScript does not make a distinction between Integers and Floating-point values. All members in JavaScript are represented as floating-point values.
Variables allow computers to store and manipulate data in a dynamic fashion. They do this by using a "label" to point to the data rather than using the data itself.
Any of the 8 data types may be stored in a variable 
Variables in JavaScript are declared using the "Var" keyword and you can declare multiple variables using this keyword.
1. Single declaration e.g  var name;
2. multiple declaration e.g. var name, money;
Storing a value in a variable is called "Variable Initialization". You can initialize a variable at the time of creation or at anytime when you need to use the variable
Use the "Var" keyword only for declaratin or initialization. You should not declare the same variable twice.
JavaScript is an untyped language. This means it can hold a value of any data type. The value type of a variable can change during execution of the program 
and Javascript takes care of it automatically.
