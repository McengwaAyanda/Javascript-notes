# Java Basics

# Comments
Comments are lines of code that are ignored intentionally. They are a great way to make notes for yourself and people reading your code.
There are two types of comments in Javascript
1. // this is an inline comment
2. /**/ this is a multi-line comment
Good commenting can help communicate the intent of your code, both for others and your future self.
